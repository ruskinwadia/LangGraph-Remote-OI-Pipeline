# About the Pipeline

This script defines a Python `Pipeline` class that interfaces with a **remote** LangGraph server to manage conversational AI interactions. It handles creating and managing conversation threads, sending user messages, updating conversation state, and retrieving AI-generated responses.

## Overview

- The `Pipeline` class maintains conversation threads on the remote LangGraph server, identified by unique thread IDs.
- It supports creating new threads and editing the state of existing threads with message history.
- The main method, `pipe`, is an asynchronous generator that processes user input, sends it to the LangGraph server, polls for completion, and yields responses incrementally.
- The pipeline provides creative waiting quotes during processing to enhance user experience.
- It parses AI responses for answers and citations, yielding both text and structured citation events.
- Robust error handling is included for network issues, timeouts, and unexpected errors.
- Configuration options such as the LangGraph server URL and model ID are encapsulated in the `Valves` class.

## Key Components

- **Valves**: Configuration container for model ID, LangGraph server URL, and version.
- **create_thread()**: Creates a new conversation thread on the remote server.
- **edit_state()**: Updates the conversation state with new messages and checkpoints.
- **pipe()**: Main interaction method that sends user messages, polls for results, and yields responses and citations.
- **get_random_waiting_quote()**: Returns a random creative quote to display while waiting for AI responses.

## Usage

This pipeline is designed to be loaded and used within the [Openwebui-pipelines](https://github.com/open-webui/pipelines/tree/main) framework.

## Configuration

Adjust the `Valves` class attributes to set:

- `MODEL_ID`: The model identifier to use.
- `LANGGRAPH_URL`: The base URL of your remote LangGraph server
- `VERSION`: Pipeline version.

## Error Handling

The pipeline gracefully handles network errors, server timeouts, and other exceptions, yielding informative error messages during processing.
