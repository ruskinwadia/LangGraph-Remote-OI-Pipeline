# LangGraph-Remote-OI-Pipeline

### This repository has been created to improve upon a Pipeline that integrates a remote Langgraph server with Open-Webui. We intend to discuss, improve and test the solution thoroughly before forking and raising a PR in the official Open-Webui repository.

- This pipeline was custom built to solve my requirements, let's standardize it to be as 'plug-n-play' as possible.
- Let's use the 'discussions' space extensively for collaboration !
- Any and all changes are welcome to be discussed ðŸ˜Š
